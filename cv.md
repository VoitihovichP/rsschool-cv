*__My name is Pasha, I studied to be a cook, but I realized that I want to connect my life with IT.__* 
I started with independent study, but two months later I learned about the course from the **Rs school** and decided to enroll in it. I try not to stand still, I study new material, I want to work in this area and constantly grow as a programmer

**my skills include:**
* Work with **GIT**
* Coding according to the BEM methodology
* Working with **GULP**

*__And also I study JavaScript__*

I have no experience of working as a junior developer, I took the course of Ivan Petrechenko __"Web developer 2021"__, but there was too little practical part for me!

*I have a __9th__ grade education, took the course "Web Developer 2021", in the future I plan to finish courses from the RS school*
