        My name is Pasha, I studied to be a cook, but I realized that I want to connect my life with IT. I started with independent study, but two months later I learned about the course from the Rs school and decided to enroll in it. I try not to stand still, I study new material, I want to work in this area and constantly grow as a programmer
